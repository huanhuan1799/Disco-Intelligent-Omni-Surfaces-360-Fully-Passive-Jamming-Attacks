# Disco-Intelligent-Omni-Surfaces-360-Fully-Passive-Jamming-Attacks
We highly respect reproducible research, so we try to provide the simulation codes for our published papers. There are some codes for our TWC paper "Disco Intelligent Omni-Surfaces: 360◦ Fully-Passive Jamming Attacks."

If you use this simulation code package in any way, please cite the original paper above.

For more details about the DISCO idea, please refer to our paper as follows:
